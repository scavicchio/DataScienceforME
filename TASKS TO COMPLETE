From the raw tweet data:
 - determine from the general and nyc popular tweet CSV how many tweets (% of total tweets per day) have a mention of "Coronavirus" "Covid-19" or similar 

From the sentiment tweet data: 
 - Determine the daily average "positivity" from each of the three CSV sets
 - will want to see if we can find correlation there
 - do the same for the "subjectivity" 
 - "then create a new column that is y = someFunction(of subjectivity and positivity) - basically a combined score and see if we can improve the correlation that way
 
From the COVID real data: 
    - cases per day in nyc area and seperately in the general US
    - find if there is correlation between the tweets and the data
    
From NYT API:
- api is already set up but we need to transform it into a dataframe so it can be put into a NLP analysis
- do NLP to determine the indicidual and daily "positivity" and "subjectivity" scores
